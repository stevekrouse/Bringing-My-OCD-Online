# Bringing My OCD Online: Userscripts for Enhanced Forum Browsing

 Hi, I'm Will. I'm 24 and I'm autistic. I'm learning to code and this is my first public project. I've developed userscripts that enhances my online reading experience by eliminating the dread I feel when I know I'm almost finished with a story. 
		

# Removing Threadmark Count

 The userscript changes the template Statistics (threadmark number threadmark, wordcount words) to Statistics (wordcount words).

# Renames Final Page Button to 'Last' in Navigation Bars

 The userscript renames the button right before the next button to the word Last. It's  only effective when multiple navigation buttons are present. Note: This feature will take a moment to load. This feature works on Questionable Questing.
