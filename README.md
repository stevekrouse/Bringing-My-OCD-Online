# Bringing My OCD Online: Userscripts for Enhanced Forum Browsing

 Hi, I'm Will. I'm 24 and I'm autistic. I'm learning to code and this is my first public project. I chose userscripts as my first project because I can improve my quality of life with my coding skills. They stop me from dreading the end of a story thread. The GitHub repo describes what my code does and how to install it.		
		

                                                         Before and After		
		

### Feature 1: Removing Threadmark Count. 
 The userscript removes the last column of the first image.

 The userscript changes the template Statistics (threadmark number threadmark, wordcount words) to Statistics (wordcount words).

### Feature 2: Renames the final page number button to 'Last' in the top and bottom navigation bars. 

 The userscript renames the button right before the next button to the word Last. It's  only effective when multiple navigation buttons are present. Note: This feature will take a moment to load. This feature works on Questionable Questing.

### Feature 3: Removes remaining reply count from the bottom of the page. This feature works on Questionable Questing.
 The userscript removes the number of replies then the words more messages.<br>
