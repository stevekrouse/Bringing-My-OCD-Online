# Bringing My OCD Online: Userscripts for Enhanced Forum Browsing

 Hi, I'm Will. I'm 24 and I'm autistic. I'm learning to code and this is my first public project. I've developed userscripts that enhances my online reading experience by eliminating the dread I feel when I know I'm almost finished with a story. 
		

# Feature 1: Removing Threadmark Count. 
 The userscript removes the last column of the first image.

 The userscript changes the template Statistics (threadmark number threadmark, wordcount words) to Statistics (wordcount words).

# Feature 2: Renames the final page number button to 'Last' in the top and bottom navigation bars. 

 The userscript renames the button right before the next button to the word Last. It's  only effective when multiple navigation buttons are present. Note: This feature will take a moment to load. This feature works on Questionable Questing.

# Feature 3: Removes remaining reply count from the bottom of the page. This feature works on Questionable Questing.
 The userscript removes the number of replies then the words more messages.<br>
