# Bringing My OCD Online: User Scripts for Enhanced Forum Browsing
This document describes a set of user scripts designed to enhance the browsing experience on Sufficient Velocity, Spacebattle, and Questionable Questing forums, focusing on user interface improvements. It's does that by allowing you to use the internet forums Sufficient Velocity, Spacebattle, and *Questionable Questing without knowing how close you are to finishing. I've coded them because I don't want to dread the end of stories. 

                                                        Features

* Renames final page number button to 'Last' on top and bottom navigation. It only works when there are multiple page navigation buttons instead of a button with the current page number of last page number. Additionally, it takes a second to load. This feature works on Questionable Questing.
* Removes remaining reply count from the bottom of the page. This feature works on Questionable Questing.
* Removes the Threadmark counts from the thread heading on the first page
* When looking at the threads created by an user, it removes the total reply count
