These are an in-progress set of user scripts that allow you to use the internet forums Sufficient Velocity, Spacebattle, and *Questionable Questing without knowing how close you are to finishing. I've coded them because I don't want to dread the end. 

                                                                                  Features

**Renames final page number button to 'Last' on top and bottom navigation
Removes remaining reply count from the bottom of the page
Removes the Threadmark counts from the thread heading on the first page
When looking at the threads created by an user, it removes the total reply count


*Currently, the features that work Questionable Questing are the first two bullets. 

**It only works when there are multiple page navigation buttons instead of a button with the current page number of last page number. Additionally, it can take a little time to take effect. 

                                                                                  Before and After

The user script removes the last column of the first image.
