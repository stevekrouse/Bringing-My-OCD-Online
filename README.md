# Bringing My OCD Online: Userscripts for Enhanced Forum Browsing

 Hi, I'm Will. I'm 24 and I'm autistic. I like reading stories on online forms because I get free high-quality content. I also enjoyed reading the discussions around stories that point out things I didn't notice. I created the userscripts to improve the quality of my experience while browsing the web forums. I like the userscripts because I don't read the end of a story chapter by knowing I'm almost done. The GitHub repo describes what my code does and how to install it.		

                                                         Features		

 * Renames the final page number button to 'Last' in the top and bottom navigation bars. It's  only effective when multiple navigation buttons are present. Note: This feature will take a moment to load. This feature works on Questionable Questing.		
 * Removes remaining reply count from the bottom of the page. This feature works on Questionable Questing.		
 * Removes the Threadmark counts from the thread heading on the first page		
 * When looking at the threads created by an user, it removes the total reply count		

                                                         Before and After		
 The Before and After section displays comparative images of the website before and after the script is applied. Visual aids such as boxes, circles, and arrows highlight the changes.		

 The userscript removes the last column of the first image.

 The userscript changes the template Statistics (threadmark number threadmark, wordcount words) to Statistics (wordcount words).

 The userscript renames the button right before the next button to the word Last.
