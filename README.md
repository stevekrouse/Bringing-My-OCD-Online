# Bringing My OCD Online: User Scripts for Enhanced Forum Browsing

 Hi, I'm Will. I'm 24 and I'm autistic. I like reading stories on online forms because I get free high-quality content. I also enjoyed reading the discussions around stories that point out things I didn't notice. I dislike knowing how many pages or chapters are left in a story because then I dread the end. This is my first big programming project. The GitHub repo describes what my code does and how to install it.		

                                                         Features		

 * Renames the final page number button to 'Last' in the top and bottom navigation bars. It's  only effective when multiple navigation buttons are present. Note: This feature will take a moment to load. This feature works on Questionable Questing.		
 * Removes remaining reply count from the bottom of the page. This feature works on Questionable Questing.		
 * Removes the Threadmark counts from the thread heading on the first page		
 * When looking at the threads created by an user, it removes the total reply count		

                                                         Before and After		
 The Before and After section displays comparative images of the website before and after the script is applied. Visual aids such as boxes, circles, and arrows highlight the changes.		

 The user script removes the last column of the first image.

 The userscript changes the template Statistics (threadmark number threadmark, wordcount words) to Statistics (wordcount words).
