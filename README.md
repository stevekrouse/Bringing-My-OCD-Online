# Bringing My OCD Online: User Scripts for Enhanced Forum Browsing

 Hi, I'm Will. I'm 24 and I'm autistic. I like reading stories on online forms because I get free high-quality content. I also enjoyed reading the discussions around stories that point out things I didn't notice. I dislike knowing how many pages or chapters are left in a story because then I dread the end. This is my first big programming project. The GitHub repo describes what my code does and how to install it.		

                                                         Features		

 * Renames the final page number button to 'Last' in the top and bottom navigation bars. It's  only effective when multiple navigation buttons are present. Note: This feature will take a moment to load. This feature works on Questionable Questing.		
 * Removes remaining reply count from the bottom of the page. This feature works on Questionable Questing.
